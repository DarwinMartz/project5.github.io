  <h2>About Oklahoma City</h2>

  <p>Though Oklahoma City isn't as prominent as coastal metropolitan areas like San Francisco or New York City, there are still plenty of things to do and sights to see.</p>

  <h3>Best Resturaunts</h3>
  
  <p>To the surprise of many, Oklahoma City has a wide range of different foods. See the table below for a few of my favorites.</p>
  
  <table id="foods">
  
  <thead>
  
  <tr>
  
  <th>Resturaunt</th>
  
  <th>Address</th>
  
  <th>Website</th>
  
  </tr>
  
  </thead>
  
  <tbody>
  
  <tr>
  
  <td>Cafe Kacao</td>
  
  <td>3325 N Classen Blvd, Oklahoma City, OK</td>
  
  <td><a href="https://cafekacao.com/">https://cafekacao.com/</a></td>
  
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
  
  <td>The Wedge Pizzeria</td>

  <td><a href="https://sipbobadesserts.com/">https://sipbobadesserts.com/</a></td>
  
  </tr>
  
  </tbody>
  
  </table>
  
  <p>As shown in the favorites table, resturaunts in OKC vary quite a lot. Sip Boba & Desserts and Cafe Kacao, for example, are international food/drink spots owned by locals.</p>

  <li>parties, or even</li>

  <p>However, most people purchase daily or seasonal passes to take advantage of the river. Equipment for kayaking and rowing can be rented for a low cost from the Riversport shop.</p>

  <h3>OSSM: Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics</h3>
  
  <p>OSSM is a two-year, publicly-funded boarding school from which I graduated in 2017. OSSM has sent top STEM students to prestigious universities including Harvard, Stanford, and MIT.</p>

  </figure>
  
  <p>A little known fact about OSSM is its attrition due to the heavy courseload, strict policies, and "sink or swim" culture - of the 86 person junior class present the day I arrived, only 64 of us graduated 2 years later. A whopping 26.4% dropout rate!</p>

  <p>Penn Square Mall is, according to its website, OKC's leading fashion destination with over 140 shops, a food court, and a movie theatre inside.</p>

  <h3>Asian District</h3>
  
  <p>Finally, no tour of Oklahoma City would be complete without discussing the Asian district. As a Filipino-American, the Asian district was my home within a home growing up. At the Asian district, you can find most of Oklahoma City's Asian resturaunts and grocery stores, as well as Traditional Chinese Medicine clinics and jewelry shops.</p>
